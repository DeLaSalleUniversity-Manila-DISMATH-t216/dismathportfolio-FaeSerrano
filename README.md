#Week 1
- Introduction to Discrete Mathematics DISMATH: it was tricky and interesting. 
- We should learn to think critically in this subject.
- Example problems about knights and knaves: I got the hang of it and capture my interest in the subject.
- There several types of truth such as scientific truth and legal truth however Dismath only deals with mathematical truth.
- I learned about *propositions* it is a declarative statement that can be answered by true or false
  - not proposition: "x + 1 = 11"
  - propsition: "x + 1 = 11 at x=3"
- My first encounter with symbols like  ¬  and ⊕ and they are called logical connectives where ¬  is for Negation, ∧ is for conjunction, ∨ is for disjunction,⊕ is for exclusive disjunction, → is for implication, and ↔ is for biconditional.
